# Germanium Segregation & Vibration Monitoring Simulation

## Overview
This project implements a fully software-based simulation framework that models
Germanium impurity segregation during zone refining using the Scheil–Pfann
equation and integrates virtual vibration monitoring for process diagnostics.
The project bridges materials science process modeling with vibration analysis
and signal processing, making it relevant to both research and industrial
testing environments.
